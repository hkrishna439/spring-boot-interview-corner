### @Scope
- scope annotations define the lifecycle and visibility of beans. By default, Spring beans are singleton, but you can use different scope annotations to modify the behavior according to your needs.

#### Types of Scope Annotations
1. @Singleton (Default Scope)
2. @Prototype
3. @RequestScope
4. @SessionScope
5. @ApplicationScope
6. @RefreshScope (from Spring Cloud)

#### 1. Singleton Scope (Default)
- Annotation: No special annotation required (default behavior).
- Description: Only one instance of the bean is created and shared across the entire Spring context.

```java
@Component
public class MySingletonService {
    // Default singleton scope
}
```
- Use Case: Use for stateless services or shared resources.

#### 2. Prototype Scope
- Annotation: @Scope("prototype")
- Description: A new instance of the bean is created every time it is requested from the container.
```java
@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class MyPrototypeService {
}
```
- Use Case: Use when you need a new instance for every request, such as in multi-threaded environments.
#### 3. Request Scope
- Annotation: @RequestScope
- Description: A new bean instance is created for each HTTP request. After the request is completed, the bean is discarded.

```java
@Component
@RequestScope
public class MyRequestScopedService {
}

```
- Use Case: Use for request-specific data, such as user session details in web applications.

#### 4. Session Scope
- Annotation: @SessionScope
- Description: A new bean instance is created for each HTTP session. The bean will last as long as the session is active.

```java
@Component
@SessionScope
public class MySessionScopedService {
}
```
- Use Case: Use to store session-specific data (e.g., user preferences or shopping cart details).

#### 5. Application Scope
- Annotation: @ApplicationScope
- Description: A singleton bean, shared across the entire application (similar to @Singleton but specific to web applications).

```java
@Component
@ApplicationScope
public class MyApplicationScopedService {
}

```
- Use Case: Use for global application-wide state, like configuration or settings shared across multiple sessions.

#### 6. Refresh Scope (Spring Cloud)
- Annotation: @RefreshScope (from org.springframework.cloud.context.config.annotation)
- Description: Allows a bean to be refreshed at runtime when there are changes in configuration (useful for configurations from external sources like Config Server).

``` java
@RefreshScope
@Component
public class MyConfigService {
    @Value("${my.config.value}")
    private String configValue;
}

```
- Use Case: Use for applications that need to refresh beans dynamically when configuration changes without restarting the app.

#### Example: Injecting Different Scoped Beans
```java
@RestController
public class DemoController {

    private final MySingletonService singletonService;
    private final MyPrototypeService prototypeService;

    public DemoController(MySingletonService singletonService, MyPrototypeService prototypeService) {
        this.singletonService = singletonService;
        this.prototypeService = prototypeService;
    }

    @GetMapping("/test")
    public String testScopes() {
        return "Singleton: " + singletonService.hashCode() + 
               ", Prototype: " + prototypeService.hashCode();
    }
}

```

#### output

```
Singleton: 12345678, Prototype: 87654321

```
- Note: On every request, the prototype bean will have a different hash code, but the singleton bean will retain the same hash code.

### @Bean
- @Bean annotation is used in @Configuration classes to define beans that will be managed by the Spring container. 
 @Bean annotation is a method-level annotation that indicates that a method will create, configure, and initialize a new object to be managed by the Spring IoC container.
#### Why Use @Bean?
- Manual Bean Creation: Sometimes, Spring’s automatic configuration isn't enough, and you need to create beans manually. This is where @Bean comes into play.
- Flexibility: You can use @Bean to control the exact behavior of the objects created, offering more customization than component-scanning-based beans.
- Dependency Injection: Beans defined using @Bean can be injected into other parts of the application using @Autowired or constructor injection.
#### When to Use @Bean?
- When you want to configure an external library's object that Spring cannot automatically configure.
- When you need fine control over the instantiation logic of an object.
For objects like services, repositories, or utilities that require specific configurations
